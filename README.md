### Part 1: Title Screen

Given the source code in `HomeView`, the Candidate is to add/modify the markup, styling, and JavaScript they deem essential for a website/webapp to do the following:

* **Page Title**:

  * **Start Button**: when clicked...
    * page title sizes down
    * page title slides to the top of the page, centered horizontally
    * start the game (`CatchView`)
    * **[After Part 2]:** If trainer's name exists in local storage, load their data and continue the game

### Part 2: Game Components

The Candidate is free to design and lay out this page to their liking, **unless noted otherwise**, as well as adding extra functionality to the game.

> 💁 Some basic starter components have been included to be used or discarded as desired:

          * Save important data to local storage
            * _See Part 1 about loading progress!_

    * Must exist to the right of Pokémon on desktop viewports
    * Must exist below the Pokémon on mobile viewports

### Part 3: Collection Gallery (Pokédex)

This page (or modal window) will show a listing of each _unique_ Pokémon caught and allow the trainer to sort them by different stats and filter them by "type" with a short summary of the results. From this gallery, the trainer must have ways to go back to the game screen to capture more Pokémon.

* **Controls**:
  * Sort by: name, id, height, and speed
  * Filter by: type
    * Filters should be checkboxes.
    * Checkboxes shown should only be of the types the trainer currently has in their collection.
* **Listing**:
  * Each item must show: id, picture, name height, speed and number caught
    * **(optional)** Add any other info or functionality as desired.
    * List should update instantly upon sort or filter toggle.
* **Summary**:
  * Display the number of unique Pokémon currently shown.
  * Display the total number captured of the ones currently shown.
